# Godot Physics Sanbox (WIP)

Project for experimenting and testing Godot physics

Still a work in progress and quite messy

# Running

The first time you open the project it'll complain about missing dependencies.
When it does this press `Open Anyway`. These assets are procedurally generated,
and they will be created with a tool script the first time the project is
opened.
